## Project Overview

StrategyFox redefines online shopping by merging extended reality (XR) with multiplayer interactions, live support, and interactive 3D visualizations. Built with **Three.js** and integrated with **Shopify** for seamless product management and payments, our platform provides an all-in-one solution for modern online retail.

### Key Features

- **Multiplayer Shopping**: Engage with friends or other users in real-time as you shop together within the XR environment.
- **3D Product Viewing**: Interact with highly detailed 3D models, allowing for closer inspection of products from all angles.
- **AR Try-On**: Experience products like cosmetics or clothing virtually, trying them on in augmented reality before purchasing.
- **Live Chat & Voice Chat**: Communicate with others or customer support within the environment, adding a social layer to online shopping.
- **AI-Driven Shopping Assistant**: A chatbot and virtual assistant help answer questions, suggest products, and enhance customer experience.
